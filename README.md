# feature_wiz_classification
This Repository explores the feature wiz library to understand if features wiz provides good feature engineering or not. Validated on a binary classification dataset and saw slight improvement in accuracy with new engineered features. 

# Parameter Details
Used Feature engineering all 3 types provided. 
Kepy corr_limm to default 0.7
Avoided data augmentation and kept imbalance feature as False ( It internally does SMOTE

# Results
Slight improvement in accuracy 
Model still needs more work. 

# Future task 
Try other parameter combinations
Try AutoEncoders 
Try grid search of paramter value like in sklearn
